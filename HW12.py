print ("hello world")
#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1
#and then prints "Hello World!" at the end.
for i in range(5,0,-1):
    print(i)
print ("hello world")





#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers
#between 1 and 30.
#(HINT: Look back to HW6 on how to see if a number is divisible by another)

for v in range(0,32,2):
    print (v)









#3. Create a for loop that prints 5 different vegtibles from a list.
b = ["monkey","cheese","cat","dog","human"]
for n in b:
    print (n)








#4. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
r = input("")
p = r[::-1]
print (p)
