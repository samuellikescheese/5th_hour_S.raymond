#1. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice.
sam = (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 7, 9, 8, 10)

#2. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
even = 0
odd = 0
#3. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list.
for z in sam:
    if z % 2 == 0:
        even += 1
    else:
        odd += 1
print (f"even = {even}")
print (f"odd = {odd}")
#(HINT: The way to see if a number is even is if it is divisible by 2).

# Print the total count of even and odd numbers.
